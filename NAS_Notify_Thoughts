practical lessons learned from trying out this script
I mostly used Flow Control branching with if from TLCL chapter 27
Concepts from Linux in Action Chapter 5 Automated administration: Configuring autoomated offsite backups applied
  Example script from LiA Chapter 5 relates to TLCL Chapter 33 Flow Control: Looping with for
  I incorporated the LiA for script example into my if scripting NAS_Notify
    Specifically the logical implementation of && and || operators in the for loop 

Rewritting the scripts in for loop format may prove usefull/effective

Current script limitation is over-writing initial file download, needs improvement
